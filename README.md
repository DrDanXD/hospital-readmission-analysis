# Hospital Readmission Analysis üè•

This project analyzes patient data to identify factors influencing hospital readmissions. It involves data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, and Power BI dashboard visualization.

## Steps

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Encoding & Cleaning
- Predictive Modeling (Random Forest)
- Visual Insights using Seaborn and Power BI

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git & GitHub

## Outcome

The model predicts whether a patient is likely to be readmitted. Visual dashboards reveal insights useful for hospital administrators to reduce readmissions and cut costs.
